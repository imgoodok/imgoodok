Hi 👋, I'm Hugo Ribas (imgoodok)

🚀 Software Developer | Web & Mobile Applications
🇧🇷 Brazil

I build real-world web and mobile applications using React, TypeScript, and Android (Kotlin).
My focus is on product-oriented development, clean and maintainable code, and solutions designed for real users, not just demos.

I have hands-on experience creating complete products, including cloud data persistence, PDF reports, dashboards, alarms and notifications, and project sharing features.
